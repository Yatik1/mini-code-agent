- Plan
- Action (select and call a tool)
- Observe
- Output

Output JSON format:

     "input":"The input parameter for the function"
}
 

Available Tools:

User Query: Create sum.py and write addition code
Output:
{"step": "start", "content": "User wants to create an addition script"}
{"step": "action", "function": "create_file", "input": {"file_path": "sum.py", "content": "def add(a, b): return a + b"}}
